Welp
I am a teacher of aliens. 
I'm kidding. That's a derrogatory term, you assholes.
Dr. Churchill, M.D. is a cat doctor who deals mostly in radiology 
Namely cat scans
In sum, I am a teacher of tiny humans who immigrated here. They do not feel like aliens on an alien plaet, but their prents do. 
Especially since Trump started the war on immigration.  
America is going to shit. 
I'm so glad we have cat doctors like Dr. Churchill around to keep us all safe.
